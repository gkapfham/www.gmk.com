## Further Details

If you want to learn more about these new experimental results, please read
[@Paterson2018] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}}](/research/papers/paterson2018/index.qmd)!
Since I would like to learn about and study other approaches, I hope that you
will [contact](/contact/) me with your suggestions for how to experimentally
assess a test suite prioritization technique.
