Innovating in technical areas such as software engineering and software testing,
I teach [courses](teaching/index.qmd), conduct [research](research/index.qmd),
write [papers](research/papers/index.qmd) and a [blog](blog/index.qmd), give
[presentations](research/presentations/index.qmd), create
[software](software/index.qmd), and [serve](service/index.qmd) organizations.
