## Experience Sharing

Do you have your own tips about how to effectively write a research paper? Have
you noticed sentence structures that limit your ability to effectively explain
your idea? Do you have suggestions for how I can improve the writing in my
[papers](/research/papers/) or on my [blog](/blog/)? If you do, then I hope
that you will [contact](/contact/) me to share some of your suggestions. Or, do
you want to be updated when I publish new blog posts like this one? If you do,
then please [subscribe](/support/) to my mailing list.
