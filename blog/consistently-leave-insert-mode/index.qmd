Are you interested in learning more about how I configure Vim and Neovim? Please
study the source code of my `.vimrc` that is available in the GitHub repository
[gkapfham/dotfiles](https://github.com/gkapfham/dotfiles). With that said, since
this post was written I've converted my Neovim configuration to use Lua and the
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager. This means that
you should aim to study my `init.lua` file instead!
