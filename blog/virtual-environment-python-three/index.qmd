## Further Details

Do you perform regression testing of software in industry? Or, do you conduct
regression testing on an open-source tool? Are you interested in discovering
ways to transition cutting-edge research into your practice of regressing
testing? If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, I hope that you will
soon [contact](/contact/) me with your own ideas and experiences. Finally, since
this blog post was written, my colleagues and students and I have published
additional papers about regression testing, with a focus on re-running tests for database
schemas, as explained in papers like
[@Alsharif2020] [{{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}}](/research/papers/alsharif2020/index.qmd).
