# Gregory M. Kapfhammer

Innovating in technical areas such as software engineering and software testing,
I teach [courses](teaching.qmd), conduct [research](research.qmd), write
[papers](papers.qmd) and a [blog](blog.qmd), give
[presentations](presentations.qmd), create [software](software.qmd), and
[serve](service.qmd) organizations. Working as an Associate Professor in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu) at [Allegheny
College](http://www.allegheny.edu), I am an associate editor for the [Journal of
Software: Evolution and
Process](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20477481), an academic editor
for the [PeerJ Computer Science](https://peerj.com/computer-science/) journal, a
program committee member for conferences like the [International Conference on
Software Testing, Verification and
Validation](https://cs.gmu.edu/icst/index.html) and the [International
Conference on Automated Software
Engineering](https://conf.researchr.org/series/ase), and a reviewer for journals
like [Transactions on Software
Engineering](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts). You can learn more about
me and my work by reading my [biography](biography.qmd), downloading my
[curriculum
vitae](https://github.com/gkapfham/curriculum-vitae/releases/download/v1.3.2/curriculum_vitae_kapfhammer.pdf),
and [subscribing](support.qmd) to my mailing list.
