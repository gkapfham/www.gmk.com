## Overview

<span class="special">As an experimental computer scientist, the goal of my
research is to design, implement, and rigorously evaluate techniques and tools
that support the creation of useful, dependable, and efficient software.</span>
My research addresses the challenges in fields such as software engineering,
software testing, and computer systems. I conduct this research with
undergraduates at [Allegheny College](http://www.allegheny.edu), graduate
students and professors at several universities, and colleagues in industry.
