## Overview

As an experimental computer scientist, the goal of my research is to design,
implement, and rigorously evaluate techniques and tools that support the
creation of useful, dependable, and efficient software. My research addresses
the challenges in fields such as software engineering, software testing, and
computer systems. I conduct this research with undergraduates
at [Allegheny College](http://www.allegheny.edu), graduate students and
professors at several universities, and colleagues in industry.
